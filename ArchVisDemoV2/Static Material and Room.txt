Material is a shader, used to wrap Textures around a 3D object.
To make changes in the material open material of the object/ magnifying glass in Material Slots window of the mesh.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G/Game View- To switch to game mode
Very important to have a perspective while carving a map.
Eg. Couch for a room, Door for a wall
------------------------------------------------
****Lighting needs to be rebuild ERROR
To resolve- Go to Build->Select Build Lights Only(CTRL+SHFT+;)
****At a time, at most 3 overlapping lights can be active
---------------------------------------------------
Foliage - To draw different meshes as brush, like grass
******Light Mass Importance Volume- Gives more accurate light results (Useful for level lights)
Directional Light-> Details panel-> Atmosphere Sun Light/ Fog - Check
******Lightmass Portal- Essentially to know where windows are
Window->World Settings
World Setting panel-> Lightmass-> Number of indirect light bounces- To capture light bounced around the room
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Lights
BY default only 3 stationary lights can be overlapped.
(Change Attenuation radius and/or Outer cone angle on light to resolve this issue)

Static - Fully bounced. Baked into the world. Can't be changed in anyway at runtime.
Dynamic - Movable light. Renders all shadows dynamically. Not to be used as an environmental light. Because shadows don't have prebaking.
Stationary - In-between static and movable. Allows partially baked lighting. Goves nice dynamic shadows. Can be tweaked, like changing color of stationary light.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reflections
To implement reflections, add Skylight, intensity .75
Sphere Reflection Capture- Any surface within that area casts reflection from the center of this actor
Offset of Sphere Reflection Capture actor can be changed using Capture Offset functionality
Change Influence Radius to tweak the area covered
Box Reflection Caputure- For Glassware to reflect room, in the night scene
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lightmap resolutions
For 3D Asset- Higher number gives more accurate results
When casting light on 3D object, light information is baked
For 3D Object- The higher the resolution, the more light is being baked in, because it's like bigger texture that stores the lighting
For Geometry- The lower the light resolution refers to the space between lightmap textures
In case geometry results aren't quite accurate, it's highly likely that it's because the lightmap resolution is high.
Increase in quality lead to trade-offs in map file size will get larger
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post Processing
PostProcess Volume- Gives screen with certain overrides and tells it to handle certain visuals in different ways.
Two PostProcess Volumes can be placed next to each other to give different effects in different areas.
Unbound- To wrap Post process around the level. {In the latest version, replaced with Infinite Extent; under Post Processing Volume Settings}
White Balance->Temperature- Change in room mood/color/nice subtle tint.
For flashback effects- Tweak saturation, contrast, gamma etc color modes.
Film- To simulate how actually camera takes in footage. Used for crushing shadows and highlights and mixing channels.
*****Bloom- Anytime anything on the screen is above a threshold value, it will start to blow it out. 
Size scale decides how large the bloom is. 
Size of each blur can be controlled.
Tint of each blur/pass can be of different color.
Dirt Mask Intensity- To give texture to the dirt. To give realistic lense effect.
++++++++++++++++++++++
Auto Expoture- How much of the screen has to be lit or in darkness, in order to take effect.
It automatically sets brightness between 1-2 different levels.
Speed Up/Down- Controls how quickly it goes to custom to dark environment.
Lense Flares- Kinda contagious. To give lense effect.
Ambiant Occlusion- Edges of different surfaces. Anytime they touch, it adds a darkness into them.
Radius in worldspace[checked]- Ambiant Occulsion extends upto 2 meters away in world space.
Tighter, more controlled AO at lower intensity works reasonably nicely.
Power[increased]- inside of it getting far more stronger.
Preferable to work with rold radius and tweak the rest of it from there.
Quality[increased]- smoother transition.
Bias- controls it creeps in and out of the corners.
Mip Blend- controls how it blends into the ligthmaps.
******Global Illumination- (GI Contribution) Useful for lighting.
Indirect Lighting Insensity- Controls the level of bounced lighting. 
Tweak color- only changing temperature/ color of bounced lighting. Can get similar effect by tweaking midtones and shadows of the other area.
Depth of Feild- More of a cinema technique. Adding blur to the areas that are beyond or before a certain region.
Scale- To decide the blur area
Focus Distance- To decide focus from player's point of view.
Depth of field is useful when trying to mimic a real world camera or a cinematic scene.
Motion Blur- Adds blur to anything that's moving around.
************Misc-> screen percentage- Helps a lot in VR. In VR projects, supersample them by cranking screen percentage to like 150, at which point it gives far far better image in VR.
Screen Space Reflection- reflection we can see in reflection layer.
Qaulity[increased]- slightly nicer reflections.
Mass reflection- Once it goes beneath a certain level, reflection gets affected.
Belndables- To add materials going over the top. Eg. cartoon shader or edge detection shader.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sequencer
Sequencer lets one grab any actor in the game and manipulate it in any way and keyframe those manipualtions.
Eg. Drop Camera into the scene. Move it around in various different ways at different times to create nice smooth camera track.
Main tweaks- Focal length, Focal distance, Transform, Fade{for scene transition}
Cinematics->Add level sequence=>Sequences=>Create new sequence
*****Key All Channel[Selected], Snap Eanable[Selected], Allow All Edits[Selected]
Create New Camera- To start new camera sequence
CineCameraActor->(Cam symbol selected)
SPACE- To play in realtime
Camera Cuts->Lock viewport to camera cuts[Select]
World Outliner->Search for the sequence
Auto Play[Select]
Set play rate
Set Loop for looping video
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finishing Touches
Setting IES Profile- Select all spotlights.
Lights->IES Texture=>Set to complex IES
IES is the format provided by light manufacturers, which mimics the lighting that would come from a real globe.
IES Use Intensity- Allows to use the actual brightness provided by the IES profile. Looks nice and gives reasonably accurate results.
After building Light Only; Change Light Qaulity in Build to Production.
Recommended to create production build before pushing online. At least do one at the end of the day, to get the rough idea of how things are going to look. And recommended to do it incrementally.
In production lighting, a lot more lighting calculations are done. So, lighting results are substantially more accurate. Sometimes, can brighten up areas previously unnoticed and get a whole lot of indirect lighting to end up in a certain way.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finishing Touches
Particle System
Goto the Effects Folder/Create one->Right click and create a new Particle System
Drag particle system into the world ([Emitter] in World Outliner)
Double click on particle system in content browser
Relocate particle system to the ground to build as if dust is calculated from ground level
Viewport window shows how the effect currently looks
Emitter window shows current emitter with all the effective modules. Look at the modules as if they are the stack of instructions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dust Particle
Add new module- Location->Initial Location in Emitter window
In Location, Start location gives the range of locations of the particle when the particle is first created
Get rid of Initial Velocity in Emitter window
First set the movement for the dust particle, then the material
.......................................................
Setting Movement of Dust Particles
Add new module- Acceleration->Contant Acceleration in Emitter window
Alter the size of particles in Initial Size in Emitter window
How particles work initially is that, they're squared. That why, the only value they actually consider is their X-axis. They can be set to take into account the other axes to make them into rectangles.
To stop them from cyling around and being created/destroyed so frequently, tweak Lifetime in emitter window
To spiral around a little bit, use orbit module
Add new module- Orbit>Orbit in Emitter window
.......................................................
Setting Material of Dust Particles
Essentially Orbit gives them a random rotation that circles around the current point and space
To give chaotic effect, set it to the orbit that's far far far slower but still has that round movement to imply that the dust is kinda just getting caught in that subtle breezes that we can't see.
Goto the Effects Folder/Create one->Right click and create a new Material
Double click on material in content browser
Click on prview mesh to turn it into a plane
In Material window, Right-Click and add a Particle Color node (Particle->Particle Color)
In Particle Color node, connect color[uppermost radio] to base color
In Particle System, Emitter window, set Required node's material to be newly created dust material
Hit Apply in Material tab, and check particle in the world.
In Material window, Right-Click and add a Radial Gradient Exponential node (Gradient->Radial Gradient Exponential)
Radial Gradient Exponential is useful to create transparent sphere to be used as the shape of the dust
Set material's Blend Mode to be Translucent
In Particle System, Emitter window, open Color Over Life
In Content Curve, in Point 0, In Val==0 => at 0%[beginning] of life, color is as below
In Content Curve, in Point 1, In Val==1 => at 100%[end] of life, color is as below
Color Over Life- Important to control how the dust looks in the world
Alpha Over Life, for the dust particle to fade into the existance and out of the existance'
In Material, Hold M+Left-Click or Math->Multiply
Particle Color:Alpha channel___________>Multiply:A
Radial Gradient Exponential:Radial Gradient Exponential___________>Multiply:B
Multiply____>Opacity
If Radial Gradient Exponential value is one, and alpha is zero; then opacity will be zero and it will be invisible
If Radial Gradient Exponential value is one, and alpha is one; then opacity will be one and it will be fully visible
Click on arrow next to members in point array element to duplicate
In Particle System, Emitter window, Spawn, to decrease spawn rate of dust particles
To avoid restarting the entire particle system;
Click in blank empty space next to Emitters,
Under Warmup Time(in particle system), set it to 1; it starts 1 sec to where the things would have ended up, bit nicer for the refresh
To set dust particles to automatically go invible as approached;
In Material window, Right-Click and add a Distance Blend node (Particles->Distance Blend)
Distance Blend converts the object from white to black when moved closer, being given start offset value{the point where it changes} and the blend range{how long it is grey for before going into being white or black}
In Material, Hold 1+Left-Click or Constant->Constant
For start offset value constant unit, it's going to be between it's intended opacity and invisible
At blend range constant units distance, it's no longer going to be visible
Previous Multiply_____>Multiply:A
Distance Blend:Result________>Multiply:B
Recent Multiply____>Opacity
Anti-Aliacing activates when they get too small, making them very hard to see
To fix that;
In Material, under Translucency, Responsive AA[Select]; not to anti-alias this particle, not to do any edge-blending on the particle system itself
